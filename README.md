# Dog's dating website
Group project built during my Web Development Immersive course (nov 2014 - feb 2015). 

Date my dog is a website where dog owners can create their dog's profile, send messages to other dog owners, arrange dog dates and favourite other dogs. Dog owners can also locate nearest dogs in their area. 

I specifically worked on implementing the GOOGLE Map using the gem Geocoder, Ajax request and active model serializer.

## Technology used for the project 
This project was built using Ruby on Rails, Javascript, Jquery, HTML 5, Google Maps API and various gems like Devise, Ransack, CanCan, Mailboxer, Carrierwave, Acts as Votable, Geocoder, Active model Serializer and Github. Styling done using Foundation.
